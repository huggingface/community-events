**Welcome to Keras Dreambooth event!** ü§ó 

This document summarises all the relevant information required for the event üìã.

## Introduction

Dreambooth is a ¬†fine-tuning technique to teach new visual concepts to text-conditioned Diffusion models with just 3-5 images. With Dreambooth, you could generate funny and realistic images of your dog, yourself and any concept with few images using Stable Diffusion. 
DreamBooth was proposed in¬†[DreamBooth: Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Subject-Driven Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242)¬†by Ruiz et al.
In this guide, we will walk you through what we will do in this event.

We will be training Dreambooth models using KerasCV and building demos on them. 


## Important Dates

- Kick-Off Event: March 6th, 2023
- Sprint start: March 7th, 2023
- Sprint end: April 1st, 2023
- Results: April 7th, 2023


## Getting Started üöÄ 

To get started, join us in [hf.co/join/discord](http://hf.co/join/discord) and take the role #open-source, and meet us in #keras-working-group channel. 

We will be hosting our demos in this organization on Hugging Face Hub: [keras-dreambooth](https://huggingface.co/keras-dreambooth), send a request to join [here](https://huggingface.co/organizations/keras-dreambooth/share/RMocthadPgpxxUDHtAesrbBzieDLgUfPmv) if you‚Äôd like to make a submission üôÇ

We will:

1. Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on any concept we want using Dreambooth,
2. Push the model to Hugging Face Hub,
3. Fill the model card,
4. Build a demo on top of the model.

**Warning:** The trained models need to be in one of the 4 categories mentioned in the Submission section. Please take a look at that before training your model.

**Let‚Äôs get started** üöÄ 

## **Model Training**

You can find the notebook here and adjust it according to your own dataset üëá  

[Link to notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/community-events/blob/main/keras-dreambooth-sprint/Dreambooth_on_Hub.ipynb) 

You can fine-tune on any concept that you want. Couple of inspirations for you: 

1. Lowpoly World: This [model](https://huggingface.co/MirageML/lowpoly-world) generates lowpoly worlds ü§Øüåç
2. Future Diffusion: This [model](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/Future-Diffusion) generates images in futuristic sci-fi concepts ü§ñ
3. Fantasy sword: This [model](https://huggingface.co/MirageML/fantasy-sword) generates swords for fantasy themed games üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you need more pointers on Dreambooth implementation with Keras, you can check out [this repository](https://github.com/sayakpaul/dreambooth-keras). 

**Important**: To learn how to launch a cloud GPU instance and train with Lambda, please refer to [Compute with Lambda](./compute-with-lambda.md).

## Dreambooth Diffusers Integration with KerasCV

As of now, inference and deployment options of `KerasCV` are limited, which is when the `diffusers` library comes to the rescue. With only few lines of code, we can convert a `KerasCV` model into a `diffusers` one and use `diffusers`‚Äô pipelines to perform inference. You can get more information [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/using-diffusers/kerascv). Also check out [this Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sayakpaul/convert-kerascv-sd-diffusers) for converting your `KerasCV` model to `diffusers`one. 

`diffusers`repositories on the Hub get a free Inference API and small widgets in the model page where users can play with the model.

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

# checkpoint of the converted Stable Diffusion from KerasCV
model_ckpt = "sayakpaul/text-unet-dogs-kerascv_sd_diffusers_pipeline"
pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_ckpt)
pipeline.to("cuda")

unique_id = "sks"
class_label = "dog"
prompt = f"A photo of {unique_id} {class_label} in a bucket"
image = pipeline(prompt, num_inference_steps=50).images[0]
```

## Model Hosting

At the end of [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/community-events/blob/main/keras-dreambooth-sprint/Dreambooth_on_Hub.ipynb) you will see a section dedicated for hosting, and a separate one for inference. We will be using the `huggingface_hub` library‚Äôs Keras-specific model pushing and loading functions: `push_to_hub_keras` and `from_pretrained_keras` . We will first push the model using `push_to_hub_keras`. After model is pushed, you will see the model is hosted with a model card like below üëá 

![Repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/dreamboothrepo.png)

To version the models better, enable discoverability and reproducibility, we will fill the model card.  Click `Edit model card`. We will first fill the Metadata section of the model card. If your model is trained with a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub, you can fill the datasets section with the dataset. We will provide fill `pipeline_tag` with `text-to-image` and pick a license for our model. 

![Metadata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/dreambooth-etadata.png)

Then, we will fill the markdown part. Hyperparameters and plot is automatically generated so we can write a short explanation for description, intended use and dataset.


You can find the example repository below üëá 

[keras-dreambooth/dreambooth_diffusion_model](https://huggingface.co/keras-dreambooth/dreambooth_diffusion_model)

## Model Demo

We will use Gradio to build our demos for the models we have trained. With `Interface` class it‚Äôs straightforward üëá  

```python
from huggingface_hub import from_pretrained_keras
from keras_cv import models
import gradio as gr

sd_dreambooth_model = models.StableDiffusion(
    img_width=512, img_height=512
)
db_diffusion_model = from_pretrained_keras("merve/dreambooth_diffusion_model")
sd_dreambooth_model._diffusion_model = db_diffusion_model

# generate images
def infer(prompt):
    generated_images = sd_dreambooth_model.text_to_image(
        prompt
    )
    return generated_images 
    
    
output = gr.Gallery(label="Outputs").style(grid=(2,2))

# pass function, input type for prompt, the output for multiple images
gr.Interface(infer, inputs=["text"], outputs=[output]).launch()
```

You can check out `app.py`file of the application below and repurpose it for your model!

[Dreambooth Submission - a Hugging Face Space by keras-dreambooth](https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-dreambooth/example-submission)

This app generates images of a corgi üê∂ 

![Dreambooth App](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/dreambooth_corgi.png)

## Hosting the Demo on Spaces

After our application is written, we can create a Hugging Face Space to host our app. You can go to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co), click on your profile on top right and select ‚ÄúNew Space‚Äù.

![New Space](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/new_space.png)


We can name our Space, pick a license and select Space SDK as ‚ÄúGradio‚Äù. 

![Space Configuration](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/space_config.png)

After creating the Space, you can use either the instructions below to clone the repository locally, adding your files and push, OR, graphical interface to create the files and write the code in the browser.

![Spaces Landing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/repository_landing.png)

To upload your application file, pick ‚ÄúAdd File‚Äù and drag and drop your file.

![New Space Landing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/add_file.png)

Lastly, we have to create a file called `requirements.txt` and add requirements of Dreambooth project like below: 

```
keras-cv
tensorflow
huggingface-hub
```

And your app should be up and running!

We will host our models and Spaces under [this organization](https://huggingface.co/keras-dreambooth). You can carry your models and Spaces on the settings tab under `Rename or transfer this model` and select `keras-dreambooth` from the dropdown. 

If you don't see `keras-dreambooth` in the dropdown, it's likely that you aren't a member of the organization. Use [this link](https://huggingface.co/organizations/keras-dreambooth/share/bfDDnByLbvPRYypHNUoZJgBgbgtTEYYgVl) to request to join the organization.

## Submission 

You can make submission in three themes: 

- Nature and Animals (`nature`)
- Sci-fi/Fantasy Universes (`sci-fi`)
- Consentful (`consentful`): Partner up with an artist to fine-tune on their style, with their consent! Make sure to include a reference to the artist‚Äôs express consent (e.g. a tweet) in your model card.
- Wild Card (`wild-card`): If your submission belongs to any category that is not above, feel free to tag it with wild-card so we can evaluate it out of that category.


Add the category with their IDs to the model cards for submission and add `keras-dreambooth` to model card metadata in tags section. Here's an example [model card](https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-dreambooth/example-submission/blob/main/README.md). All the submissions will be populated [in this leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/keras-dreambooth/leaderboard) and ranked according to likes on a given Space to determine the winners.

## Sprint **Prizes**

We will pick three winners among the applications submitted, according to the number of likes given to a Space in a given category.
