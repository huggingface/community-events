# JAX/Diffusers community sprint ðŸ§¨

Welcome to the JAX/Diffusers community sprint! The goal of this sprint is to work on fun and creative diffusion models using JAX and Diffusers.

In this event, we will create various applications with diffusion models in JAX/Flax and Diffusers using free TPU hours generously provided by Google Cloud.

This document is a walkthrough on all the important information to make a submission to the JAX/Diffusers community sprint.

Don't forget to fill out the [signup form]! 

> ðŸ’¡ Note: This document is still WIP and it only contains initial details of the event. We will keep updating this document as we make other relevant information available throughout the community sprint.

## Organization 

Participants can propose ideas for an interesting project involving Diffusion models. Teams of 3 to 5 will then be formed around the most promising and interesting projects. Make sure to read through the [Projects] (TODO) section on how to propose projects, comment on other participants' project ideas, and create a team.

To help each team successfully finish their project, we will organize talks by leading scientists and engineers from Google, Hugging Face, and the open-source diffusion community. The talks will take place on 17th of April. Make sure to attend the talks to get the most out of your participation! Check out the [Talks](#talks) section to get an overview of the talks, including the speaker and the time of the talk.

Each team is then given **free access to a TPU v4-8 VM** from April 14 to May 1st. In addition, we will provide a training example in JAX/Flax and Diffusers to train [ControlNets](https://huggingface.co/blog/controlnet) to kick-start your project. We will also provide examples of how to prepare datasets for ControlNet training. During the sprint, we'll make sure to answer any questions you might have about JAX/Flax and Diffusers and help each team as much as possible to complete their projects!

At the end of the community sprint, each submission will be evaluated by a jury and the top-3 demos will be awarded a prize. Check out the [How to submit a demo] (TODO) section for more information and suggestions on how to submit your project.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Even though we provide an example for performing ControlNet training, participants can propose ideas that do not involve ControlNets at all. But the ideas need to be centered around Diffusion models.

## Communication

All important communication will take place on our Discord server. Join the server using [this link](https://hf.co/join/discord). After you join the server, take the Diffusers role in `#role-assignment` channel and head to `#jax-diffusers-ideas` channel to share your idea as a forum post. To sign up for participation, fill out the [signup form] and we will give you access to two more Discord channels on discussions and technical support, and access to TPUs.
Important announcements of the Hugging Face, Flax/JAX, and Google Cloud team will be posted in the server.
The Discord server will be the central place for participants to post about their results, share their learning experiences, ask questions and get technical support in various obstacles they encounter.

## Data and Pre-Processing

In this section, we will cover how to build your own dataset for ControlNet training.

### Prepare a large local dataset

#### Mount a disk 

If you need extra space, you can follow [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/setup-persistent-disk#prerequisites) to create a persistent disk, attach it to your TPU VM, and create a directory to mount the disk. You can then use this directory to store your dataset.

#### Data preprocessing 

Here we demonstrate how to prepare a large dataset to train a ControlNet model with canny edge detection. More specifically, we provide an [example script](./dataset_tools/coyo_1m_dataset_preprocess.py) that:
* Selects 1 million image-text pairs from an existing dataset [COYO-700M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kakaobrain/coyo-700m).
* Downloads each image and use Canny edge detector to generate the conditioning image. 
* Create a metafile that links all the images and processed images to their text captions. 

Use the following command to run the example data preprocessing script. If you've mounted a disk to your TPU, you should place your `train_data_dir` and `cache_dir` on the mounted disk

```bash
python3 coyo_1m_dataset_preprocess.py \
 --train_data_dir="/mnt/disks/persist/data" \
 --cache_dir="/mnt/disks/persist" \
 --max_train_samples=1000000 \
 --num_proc=16
```

Once the script finishes running, you can find a data folder at the specified `train_data_dir` with the below folder structure:

```
data
â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .......
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image_1000000.jpeg
â”œâ”€â”€ processed_images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .......
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image_1000000.jpeg
â””â”€â”€ meta.jsonl
```

#### Load dataset

To load a dataset from the data folder you just created, you should add a dataset loading script to your data folder. The dataset loading script should have the same name as the folder. For example, if your data folder is `data`, you should add a data loading script named `data.py`. We provide an [example data loading script](./dataset_tools/data.py) for you to use. All you need to do is to update the `DATA_DIR` with the correct path to your data folder. For more details about how to write a dataset loading script, refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_script).

Once the dataset loading script is added to your data folder, you can load it with: 

```python
dataset = load_dataset("/mnt/disks/persist/data", cache_dir="/mnt/disks/persist" )
```

Note that you can use the `--train_data_dir` flag to pass your data folder directory to the training script and generate your dataset automatically during the training.
 
For large datasets, we recommend generating the dataset once and saving it on the disk with

```python
dataset.save_to_disk("/mnt/disks/persist/dataset")
```

You can then reuse the saved dataset for your training by passing the `--load_from_disk` flag.

Here is an example to run a training script that will load the dataset from the disk 

```python
export MODEL_DIR="runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
export OUTPUT_DIR="/mnt/disks/persist/canny_model"
export DATASET_DIR="/mnt/disks/persist/dataset"
export DISK_DIR="/mnt/disks/persist"

python3 train_controlnet_flax.py \
 --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_DIR \
 --output_dir=$OUTPUT_DIR \
 --train_data_dir=$DATASET_DIR \
 --load_from_disk \
 --cache_dir=$DISK_DIR \
 --resolution=512 \
 --learning_rate=1e-5 \
 --train_batch_size=2 \
 --revision="non-ema" \
 --from_pt \
 --max_train_steps=500000 \
 --checkpointing_steps=10000 \
 --dataloader_num_workers=16 
 ```

### Prepare a dataset with MediaPipe and Hugging Face 

We provide a notebook ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/community-events/blob/main/jax-controlnet-sprint/dataset_tools/create_pose_dataset.ipynb)) that shows you how to prepare a dataset for ControlNet training using [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) and Hugging Face. Specifically, in the notebook, we show:

* How to leverage MediaPipe solutions to extract pose body joints from the input images.
* Predict captions using BLIP-2 from the input images using ðŸ¤— Transformers.
* Build and push the final dataset to the Hugging Face Hub using ðŸ¤— Datasets. 

You can refer to the notebook to create your own datasets using other MediaPipe solutions as well. Below, we list all the relevant ones:

* [Pose Landmark Detection](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/pose_landmarker)
* [Face Landmark Detection](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker)
* [Selfie Segmentation](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/image_segmenter)
